# Hello-World
Let's do this!

My name is Steve Spellman and I'm here to learn a skill I think I'll enjoy and be good at. I want to enable myself to have a successful, and fun career. I've worked at an IT consulting firm in NYC for the last 3.5 years, and while I love the people at my company, I'd rather build and create something than react to break/fix issues. I'm excited to start this next chapter of my professional life, and am going into it guns blazing.
